# Windows Activation Project

## Overview
This repository is intended **for educational purposes only**. It showcases how to automate interactions with Windows license management commands (`slmgr.vbs`) using batch scripting. The primary goal of this project is to provide insights into how Windows systems are activated and how batch scripting can be used for system automation.

## Disclaimer
This project is strictly for **learning and experimentation**. It does not encourage or promote illegal usage of activation methods. We strongly advise obtaining legitimate licenses for any software used.

## Features
- Demonstrates Windows product key installation using `slmgr.vbs`.
- Automates attempts to connect to public KMS servers.
- Provides feedback on the activation process and offers the option to restart the system.

## Prerequisites
- Windows operating system (any version that supports the `slmgr.vbs` command).
- Basic understanding of batch scripting.

## How It Works
1. The script installs a series of pre-defined Windows product keys.
2. It attempts to activate Windows by connecting to different KMS servers.
3. If successful, it prompts the user to restart the system.

## Usage
To use this script:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/windows-activation.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd windows-activation-automation-educational
3. Run the batch file as administrator:
    ```bash
    .\activate-windows.bat
